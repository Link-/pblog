I will always remember how scary the period when I first entered the job market after University was. **My entire future depended on a set of decisions that as a young adult felt not ready for.** **There was too much uncertainty and too many unknowns.** I was walking in the dark and who likes that?

Thousands of hours, dozens of books, millions of lines of code and hundreds of cringe-worthy mistakes later I developed the needed wisdom to successfully (or so I think) navigate the field of Software Engineering.

No doubt **the internet is full of countless articles, books, pieces of truth** and advice relevant to our domain. And yet I have spent the past [3 years of my life coaching engineers](https://sefactory.io/) fresh out of college on how to build successful careers.

**The problem with all this information is that it’s too scattered.** It’s too difficult for the inexperienced to devise a strategy to digest it.

This guide comes as a **comprehensive series of 11 long articles** detailing what every aspiring software engineer ought to know. What follows is an attempt to put down briefly and simply, how I came to the craft, what I know about it now, and how it’s done.

My hope for this guide is to be an effective reference, **allowing you to identify the different pieces of the puzzle and providing you with insights into what you should know** before starting, and during your career as a software engineer.

Who is this Guide For?
======================

In general, this series of articles is **relevant to anyone who has taken or is considering software engineering as a career.** I have attempted to keep the articles decoupled so that each can be read independently in no particular order. Of course, I have published them in the order that I believe makes the most sense but you’re free to skip the ones you deem irrelevant.

**In case you’ve spent a few years working professionally in the field**, you most probably have learned all that I’m about to share. **This guide is not for you.** It’s intended for a less experienced audience. But, it doesn’t hurt to skim through the summary at the bottom of each article. You never know what gems might be hiding there.

Format
======

Throughout this series, you will notice the extensive usage of **bold sentences.** The purpose of these sentences is to **allow you to skim through the articles** and immediately capture the ideas I’m trying to convey.

In the future, **I will attempt to add a narrated version of these articles** for those of you who prefer listening more than reading.

Lastly, all references will be added at the bottom of each article and books will be linked to Amazon or Goodreads.

Disclaimer
==========

Much of the information shared in this series is inspired by my own personal experience. This guide should not be used as a rulebook, it ought to be thought-provoking material. **Take the time to reflect on your own personal experience, do your own extended research and connect the dots.**

I have made an **absolute best effort at giving credit** and referencing material that has been quoted from books or other articles. In case you find something that has not been appropriately credited please let me know.
