A2. Learn how to Learn
======================

The Fall
========

As a child, I never struggled at school. Up until grade 9 or 10 I was constantly among the top 15% of the class. Back then, I didn’t know how I achieved these results. For me, studying was effortless and all it took was paying attention in class and _somehow_ the material made its way into my brain and got stuck there. Focus came naturally to me. Maybe as a result of not being allowed to play outside of the house much? Or genetics? Probably a combination of both.

Back then, I had plans for what I wanted to study when I grew up: Genetic Engineering —whaaat? Don’t ask me where that came from. **It felt as if I was born with a set of talents that allowed me to be and do whatever I desired.** Parents, teachers, and peers — all having rudimentary or no knowledge of how learning works — **fueled my ego and delusional ambitions**. In everyone’s mind, mistakingly, the world belonged to those who performed well on standardized tests.

Throughout the entirety of the summer break, all my school friends were discussing how difficult high school was going to be. And the dreaded autumn came. I still vividly remember the first lecture of my sophomore year in high school. It was a Mathematics class.

You see, I attended a private school that took pride in graduating high achievers. They did that by segregating students in the senior year into 2 emphasis categories: the sciences and literature. **This segregation happened based on the performance of these students in their sophomore and junior years. Your entire future was determined by where you landed. It was final**, there were no second chances. Students whose high school years emphasized the sciences were eligible to study scientific fields at University, and of course, those who focused on literature majored in the fields that did not require any science pre-requisites.

From a high-level perspective, this is all fine and dandy. **In theory, students didn’t have to struggle with the material they didn’t have an aptitude for, instead, they were given direction and allowed to focus on what they were good at.** But reality, as you’re well aware, isn’t always as clean. In this part of the world, you’re a medical doctor, an engineer or a lawyer or you’ve got no worth in society. This meant that if you failed to make the cut for the science-focused classes you lost your chance of majoring in Engineering or Medicine, forever. In general, **whenever you create a funnel pressure is bound to build up.** Now imagine the pressure the students and their parents were under. It’s as if life, with all its diversity of choices, was reduced to being an M.D. or an Engineer!

Let’s get back to that Mathematics class. I was both excited and anxious. Our teacher, whom I can’t remember the name no matter how hard I tried, was as tall as a poplar tree and just as thin. He was bald with a large forehead, had a faint voice and a forward head posture. Soon after entering the class, with his faint voice, he asked: “Who can define a point?” In all the years prior, I was known for my wit and I used to enjoy puzzle-like questions, but for the first time, I didn’t have anything remotely close to an answer.

How could that be? I thought. You know in the movies when the protagonist loses her magical powers all of a sudden and she falls into a pit of despair? That’s exactly how I felt. Instead of focusing on the rest of the lecture and trying to make the best out of it, I was trying to pick up my shattered ego.

What happened in this lecture persisted for far more than I am proud to admit. **Throughout the 3 years of high school, I wasn’t able to make peace with the fact that focusing in class and relying on my recollection was not sufficient anymore to pass exams. I refused to accept that I needed to study. I did not want to work hard, that was beneath me.**

I finished sophomore and junior years grazing the passing threshold and went into my senior year on condition that I should score substantially above average otherwise I should switch to literature or I will be kicked out of school. **In the middle of the first semester, I was kicked out.**

I was devastated and utterly destroyed. Parents disappointed. Everything has been lost. All prospects of a career in engineering have disappeared — needless to say, that’s not how the world works but that’s what I had in mind.

TK (missing part of the story)

**This horrible behavior persisted throughout my University years. It was the source of depression**, lack of confidence, a deep sense of failure, cynicism and overall sadness… **I used to analyze the behavior of my peers and think how could they be so much more intelligent than I am?**

Little did I know, **I was asking the wrong questions!**

The Right Questions
===================

In retrospect, I regret that it took so long for me to find the right path but I didn’t know better. I was blind to the truth that was right in front of my eyes. **I victimized myself and blamed everyone and everything for my failures except for one person. The right question should have been: What is wrong with my approach?**

The answer is as simple and as cliché as this: **learning success requires hard work and the application of suitable learning methods.**

Let’s break down the above into something digestible. First I want to talk about failure and mistakes. Then we will jump into a discussion of learning methods and how you can make learning fun, result oriented, productive, less stressful and more efficient.

Mistakes
--------

Mistakes, in general, are small failures and **failure is fine, it’s an integral part of the learning process and it is inevitable**. The real problem is **recurring mistakes**.

**Recurring Mistakes**
----------------------

> Recurring Mistakes refers to the usage of incorrect or suboptimal steps for achieving a desired outcome and then repeating the same steps expecting different results when the outcome has not been achieved.

We’re all familiar with the necessity of evaluation. For every decision we make, different parts of the brain come into play. Millions of neurons fire their synapses to process sensory input, collect memories and evaluate this melange of data to yield a decision. **In order to assess whether one of our decisions — translated to action — has generated the desired outcome, we evaluate what we’ve done versus what we’ve achieved.** Except, **for some reason, it’s easier for us (the untrained) to assume that not reaching the desired outcome is due to some external factor and not something we’ve done ourselves.** Maybe it’s a defense and self-preservation mechanism or the consequence of conditioning, I’m not entirely sure.

Recurring mistakes happen when:

1.  our evaluation of the outcome leads us to the wrong conclusions about the causes of failure
2.  when an evaluation does not happen at all

The latter is a rare occurrence. We’ve been trained since quite a young age to identify what’s right and wrong, good and bad, black and white etc. However, under certain circumstances like pressure, anxiety, stress, and anger we fail to conduct an evaluation of outcomes. This leads to recurring mistakes.

The former is definitely a more frequent cause of recurring mistakes. Until today, I cannot count the number of times I’ve attributed my failure to some external cause: I didn’t have enough time, or my boss is an asshole, or the educational system is bad, or I can’t function under pressure, or I’m not paid enough, or I’m not smart enough, or … Yet, there’s always been this faint voice at the back of my head buzzing the words: that’s not true, something’s wrong with your conclusions. This voice definitely gets louder with experience. It’s important to listen to it. I’m not suggesting to take it at face value, no. I’m merely suggesting that it’s valuable to hear it out and let this voice make its case.

The Learning Cycle
==================

There is an abundance of literature on the topic of learning. I don’t intend for this chapter to be a review of existing research. Instead, I want to share my perspective. **The following is my understanding of the art of learning.**

Intelligence and Learning
-------------------------

I’m going to make a controversial statement now: **Intelligence can be made irrelevant in determining learning success by applying the appropriate learning methods.**

There is a widespread misconception that high achievers are what they are due to their superior and innate intelligence — with a very arbitrary definition of intelligence. Countless times I’ve heard the misguided use of the word “Genius”. In my opinion, **high achievers have figured out the best approach to maximize their learning success and are constantly applying it.**

So, moving forward, please put the “I’m not smart enough” excuse aside and let’s really attack the problem: **how to learn.**

Spaced Repetition
-----------------

TK — talk about the subject and how it’s included in the technique described below

Self Directed Learning
----------------------

A lot of attempts have been made to define a unified theory for adult education also known as [Andragogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andragogy) \[1\]. Self Directed Learning is one such attempt. It is a model that defines the distinction between adult and child learners. It also outlines the techniques of application. So far, there is not a single model or theory that encompasses all that we know about adult learning.

In this section, I’m going to describe my own thoughts on the matter. And I’m going to be using the term Self Directed Learning to mean self-teaching. **Hopefully, this will help you look within and define a strategy to achieve the highest levels of learning success.**

> **It all starts with a burning urge to make ourselves better, to level up.** This flame of desire is essential to kickstart the engines of learning.

The urge could be as simple as: I want to play a musical instrument. I want to learn a new language. I want to paint. I want to compose music. I want to impress my friends with my knowledge of botany (good luck with this one). I want to watch professional chess tournaments and understand what’s happening. I want to write a novel. I want to cook a nice dinner for my date …

When you identify an urge or more accurately when the urge comes to you, your brain will usually respond with: Naah, I’m too old to start learning this now. My friends will laugh at me. I’m not intelligent enough to do this. Ugh, this will take years. I don’t have time for this. I can’t afford it …

> M**ute the voices of doubt in the back of your head. If you want it, you can have it.**

At this point, you have four paths you can take:

1.  Surrender to your doubts and dismiss the urges or postpone them (which is the same as dismissing them).
2.  Accept the challenge but soon falter under the magnitude of the work ahead.
3.  Call for the help of someone who can teach you the subject matter (boring…).
4.  **My personal favorite, tackle the challenge head-on and teach yourself.** How you might wonder? I’ll tell you.

Autodidacticism
---------------

That’s quite a fancy word, [autodidacticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodidacticism). It simply means self-teaching. I’ve taught myself how to code before hair started growing under my armpits. In the beginning, my method was sloppy, arbitrary and chaotic. I perfected it over time and now I can pick up any subject and reach a decent level of competency within a relatively short period.

In 2014, I was working for a consulting firm that took the job of delivering a high-level design for an advanced traffic management system for one of the biggest metropolitan tunnel and highway networks in the USA. I was the lead architect on the project. I knew nothing about traffic networks or the systems that manage them. The best part? Client presentation is happening in exactly 30 days from when I was assigned the project.

Seventy technical manuals, ten thousand user stories, twelve design iterations later I delivered operational flowcharts, logical system diagrams, integration diagrams, and physical infrastructure diagrams. The client was happy and I was able to sleep now. In 30 days I not only had to learn how the transportation networks are managed but also the details of hundreds of systems that support the operation. This would have been an impossible feat without my experience in self directed learning.

How?

**Take a moment to go through the flow chart above, I’ll wait for you.** Start with “Urge to learn X” and follow the arrows.

**\[ Urge to learn X \]** This one is pretty much self explanatory. Remember not to focus on the self doubt associated with the urge. Think of yourself first and foremost and forget everyone else for now.

**\[ X is esoteric? \]** Is the subject matter you wish to learn only accessible to a few gifted people? Yes? Then I’m afraid seeking the guidance of a teacher is necessary In this case. I wonder though what such a subject could be…

**\[ X requires tools? \]** Does what you’re learning require tools? Are you absolutely sure you need them? If yes, get them. Are they expensive? Buy what you can afford. This is especially the case when it comes to music, photography, or other tool requiring hobbies. A lot of people starting out ask questions about which tool is best for beginners. My answer to this is pretty simple: buy whatever you can afford. In the early stages of learning, the tool will not make much of an impact. **If you practice correctly you will see satisfying results irrespective of the tool you use.** As you become more experienced the tool will allow you to expand and optimize your process and make marginal gains, but that’s for later.

**\[ Identify a small list of resources to learn from \]** These could be anything: books, youtube videos, articles, or documentation etc. And by small, I mean, 3 to 4 resources only. Once you have identified this list, STOP. Don’t dig in just yet.

**\[ Spend a small amount of time browsing \]** Spend a couple of hours skimming through the resources. **Skimming is the art of identifying whether a resource contains valuable information or can be skipped.** Eliminate resources that are: complicated, too detailed, and intimidating. Keep the ones that are easy to read, written in understandable language, and don’t contain too much scary jargon (technical terms). Don’t worry if you’ve made the right choices yet, you just need barely enough to start. You can always come back and edit the list, eh?

**\[ Immediately identify a small exercise to practice \]** I personally like to get my hands dirty as soon as possible. **If I don’t, I lose momentum and that’s something I cannot afford to do at this stage**. This is, in my opinion, the most important step of the process. Think of something sensible for this stage you wish to build or practice. If you’re learning a new programming language, start with basic exercises from [projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/) or the likes. If you’re learning a musical instrument learn 1 technique exercise recommended by the list of resources you identified. **What matters the most is to start immediately.**

**\[ Practice technique and build up theory \]** A lot of people make the mistake of spending too much time on either one but not both in parallel. Doing so is a guarantee that you won’t make progress, you will be bored to death and you will eventually give up. No wonder a lot of youngsters feel like music learning sessions are torture. It’s usually because their instructors focus too much on either building technique or musical theory. **A formula that works well for me is: for each hour of practice spend half an hour on theory.**

**\[ Identify a checkpoint goal that provides gratification \]** I cannot emphasize enough how critical small attainable targets are. **Many learners do not identify milestones or checkpoint goals and end up getting frustrated after spending a couple of months practicing without attaining their expectations.** Imagine going to the gym for the first time ever and you’ve never lifted weights a day in your life, how much can you realistically lift on the first day? My bet is you won’t lift much more than the empty axe. That’s ok, because now you know where you are! From here, you can set the goal for the upcoming week. Axe + 5KGs sounds like a reasonable target.

**\[ Reached checkpoint goal after 1 week? \]** There are 2 elements to discuss here. The first is the importance of constant evaluation. **Constantly evaluating your progress will allow you to correct your path before it’s too late** (refer to the section about “recurring mistakes”). The second is the period in between evaluations. I believe 1 week is _usually_ a good period. It’s not too short and not too long. Feel free to adapt this period to your liking without jeopardizing momentum.

**\[ Did not attain your checkpoint goal? \]** Then you need to correct your expectations! **Keep lowering the checkpoint goal until it is attainable. Remember, it’s okay to make small progress. It’s not ok to make 0 progress.** If you’re not making progress at all then it’s time to revise your practice. There could be something wrong with your technique or you’re not practicing enough or even practicing too much. There is also something to be said about spaced repetition here, but I’ll leave that to the section below.

**\[ Attained your checkpoint goal? \]** Superb! You’re doing great, continue.

**\[ Anything else to learn? \]** So far, **I have never embarked on a learning cycle where the answer to this question was a yes.** There is always something to learn. **So when do you stop? When digging deeper brings very little reward.**

**\[ Share progress with support group \]** I am blessed to have great friends who care about my personal growth and whom I can rely on for moral support. These friends also rely on me to be part of their support group. Find that one person or a group of people who will celebrate with you these small wins. Don’t underestimate the power of praise and constructive feedback. **No matter how self driven you are, a friendly emotional boost can do wonders.**

**\[ Phase 2 \] \[ Reflect on acquired knowledge and build learning plan \]** You can skip this step in the early stages. Sooner or later though you will start feeling you have more control and curiosity of the topic you’re learning. Then would be the perfect time to take a few minutes (or hours) to ponder upon what you’ve been doing lately. Hold yourself accountable: what have I achieved? Why am I doing this? Is this a waste of time? Praise yourself: I think I’m making good progress. I’m so happy to have been able to do X. Critique yourself: I didn’t practice enough this week. I have not been disciplined enough. What do I need to change to get better results? Think of the future. Where am I heading? How deep does the rabbit hole go? **Use the answers to all these questions to understand where you are exactly in the learning path.** **Don’t use them to discourage yourself!** Use them as coordinates pinpointing your exact location. If you know where you are you can define a direction and start walking closer towards your goal. If you don’t know where you are any direction you take would be just as good as standing still. The more reflection you do, the clearer the path you need the pursue will become. You will never fully get rid of the myopic view of the endless tunnel but the picture will get clearer at least enough for you to walk confidently.

**\[ Update and diversify practice exercises \]**

That’s it! I’m sure you might be thinking that the above is self-evident. But so is any topic once it’s laid down clearly in front of you.
