> Discuss cool stuff with jq

My love for `jq` is endless! This is the ultimate Swiss army knife for anything that involves `JSON`. Because this is not an opinionated post, let's just get to the point right away.

First, [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) have terrific documentation. It's fun to read and filled with great examples of the myriads of features this little utility is packed with.

## What is `jq`?

> Skip if you know the tool already

`jq` is a CLI tool to which you can pass a JSON object and then apply filters on it. You can chain filters to more surgical extractions of the content most relevant to you.

I've also learned lately that `jq` can parse the input in a streaming fashion and output an array of path and leaf values ðŸ˜²

If you deal with a lot of REST APIs, or you're building CI/CD pipelines that require handling a lot of JSON or you do a lot of system integration work, this tool is fundamental for you.

## What is it good for?

### TBD
