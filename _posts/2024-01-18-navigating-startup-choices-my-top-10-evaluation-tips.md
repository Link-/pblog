In my 15-year journey across tech, I've learned that deciding which new venture to join, especially as a founding engineer, is an art in itself. Through my experiences, I've distilled essential criteria that I always use to evaluate a startup's health and its impact on the quality of work life.

**Technical Co-founder Presence:** Assess if the founder has a technical co-founder. Without one, you may end up performing their duties without appropriate compensation.

**Founder's Venture Experience:** Consider whether the startup is the founder's first venture. Previous successes or failures can impart valuable experience, whereas a first-time founder may face significant learning curves and failures.

**Financial Runway:** Evaluate the startup's financial runway, i.e., how many months it can operate before running out of funds. A good startup should have a sufficient runway, ideally up to two years, to reach product-market fit.

**Founder-Investor Relationship:** Investigate the relationship between the founders and their investors. A bad relationship can create internal friction and distract from achieving product-market fit.

**Startup's Funding Source:** Understand how the startup is financing its operations. Founders using personal savings may be more risk-averse and controlling, whereas external funding might lessen the pressure.

**Founder's Industry Relevance:** Check if the founders have experience in the industry of their startup. Lack of industry knowledge can lead to misjudging the market and the viability of the solution.

**Perception of Engineering:** Gauge how the founder perceives engineering work. Some may undervalue it or consider outsourcing it, while others might overemphasize it at the expense of business outcomes.

**Shadow Stakeholders:** Look out for hidden stakeholders who may influence decision-making, limiting the founder's ability to effect positive changes quickly.

**Presence of Advisors:** Be wary of founders surrounded by numerous advisors, as their advice may be generic and not actionable, showing a lack of commitment to the startup‚Äôs specific challenges.

**Founder's Management Style:** Consider if the founder is a micromanager, which can lead to focusing on trivial details over more critical aspects like product development and market fit.
