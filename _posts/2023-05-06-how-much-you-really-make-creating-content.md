Truth time! I love transparency because it takes away the uncertainty and illusions. It helps and inspires people to plan and execute based on facts, not bullshit.

Here are the results of being a (part time) content creator for ~2 years now.

I created and published over `137 Youtube videos` (long and short form), in addition to `30 TikTok videos` (those that didn't make it to Youtube), equivalent to hundreds of hours of content.

I single handedly scripted, shot, edited and designed an entire brand. [Built and released a product](https://glich.stream/tkg) and engaged with you all across 5 social media networks ([Youtube](https://glich.stream/youtube), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/BassemDy/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BassemDy), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bassemdghaidy/) and [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@glich.stream)).

Throughout this entire journey:

- I have made a total of ü•Å ... drum roll ... ü•Å `~148 EUR` from Youtube ad revenue, `0 EUR` from TikTok, Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.
- I have earned up to `~2,000 EUR` from Patreon cumulative, 1 off donations and consulting work.
- `49%` of this gross revenue was paid in taxes.

I know many other creators who made `0 USD` for all their years of sharing value with the world.

Moral of the story is, be kind to the content creators you like. Only a handful are getting rich in the process. The drive for many of us is to add value to the world and share our knowledge.

And for those who are inspired to create, know that this is a ‚Äúlong‚Äù and painful process. You will not get rich anytime soon EVEN when you go viral (and my content went viral several times).

Your drive needs to be something else.

And just to be clear, I‚Äôm not seeking advice or ideas on how to do better. I know exactly what I‚Äôm doing, and I know exactly that if I compromise some of the principles I‚Äôm building on top of (no clickbait bullshit), I can earn much more. This is a post to share my experience nothing more.

Stay awesome and keep building ‚ù§Ô∏è
